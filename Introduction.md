## Introduction of  Knowledge graph reasoning 
##### Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) is answering multichip queries accounting for missing facts, heterogeneity & massive KGs
##### KGR  enable wide range of AI applications, such as question answering (forecast future facts/explanations),recommendation systems (deduce new facts/missing links) and dialogue systems

##### Knowledge graph reasoning of two kinds static knowledge graph and temporal knowledge graph 
  ##### Static KG :(𝑒_𝑡,𝑒_1𝑞,𝑟_(𝑞  ) )  and Temporal KG:(𝑒_𝑡,𝑒_1𝑞,𝑟_(𝑞  ),𝑡_(𝑠  ) )


##### The reasoning task is to  provide and answer for below question from below graph  just based on tripples from the KG

##### Answering this type of question is challenging because of missing links and incomplete information. If all relationships were known, classical logic could provide a deterministic answer through inference rules using forward chaining. However, this approach is not feasible for large, incomplete graphs. Therefor we rely on techniques mentioned [here](https://github.com/SankarshU/Knowledge-Graph-Reasoning/blob/c3f663ce2d3c2592e87870e12716c93457b81818/README.md) 

##### We will use a specific example of troubleshooting to illustrate a particular technique along with its technical framework with the following [Illustration](https://github.com/SankarshU/Knowledge-Graph-Reasoning/tree/c41d600d4888914932d189f137548b16da48e2c3/Experiments_with_CURL)
