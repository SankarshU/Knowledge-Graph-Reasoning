## Introduction of  Knowledge graph reasoning 
##### Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) is answering multichip queries accounting for missing facts, heterogeneity & massive KGs
##### KGR  enable wide range of AI applications, such as question answering (forecast future facts/explanations),recommendation systems (deduce new facts/missing links) and dialogue systems

##### Knowledge graph reasoning of two kinds static knowledge graph and temporal knowledge graph 
  ##### Static KG :(𝑒_𝑡,𝑒_1𝑞,𝑟_(𝑞  ) )  and Temporal KG:(𝑒_𝑡,𝑒_1𝑞,𝑟_(𝑞  ),𝑡_(𝑠  ) )


##### The reasoning task is to  provide and answer for below question from below graph  just based on tripples from the KG

##### Answering this type of question is challenging because of missing links and incomplete information. If all relationships were known, classical logic could provide a deterministic answer through forward chaining. However, this approach is not feasible for large, incomplete graphss
